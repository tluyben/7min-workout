7min workout

These are copies, with added (planned) enhancements of 7-min.com by Lindsay Silver. 

This code/sounds/images are used with permission of Lindsay. I turned this into an app because
I don't have internet in the places I work out and I will forget to take the web app.

As I didn't create the actual software I did not add any payments or ads. 

Download here from Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vafive.sevenminworkout

New features; 
- speech 
- vibration
- configurable sound / vibration
- prevent the phone going to sleep 

-----

~~I am using Adobe Phonegap Build to build this app; you can try building it  yourself there as well.~~
I use Eclipse to build now because of the plugin (TTS) and sleep prevention. 

TODO: 

- Add a reminder service 
- Add a nagging reminder service
- Add FB integration to show your friends (more stimulating) 
- Progress indicator working on phone
